# log-file-parsing

## Scope
Python library for parsing of Sentinel log files.

This repo contains a file that implements some template/rough/not done code for parsing log files.

A log file is provided for reference.  This file was created during integration testing of the unit, so the tube locations are finicky.  Basically, the unit was turned on/off and set up multiple times during testing, which results in duplicates of tubes at varying locations.

## Dependencies
- matplotlib
